# Melting-Snowman

## Overview:
This document outlines the requirements for the software implementation of the classic game of Hangman with a winter twist. This software will provide the user with the opportunity to play Melting Snowman, and it will keep track of his score. The description of the game and the requirements of this implementation are presented below.

## The Game:
The user will be presented with an inviting game screen. On the top of the screen, there will be a toolbar with a start button, a message box, and a score box. On the middle, left of the screen, there will be 26 buttons, each displaying one letter of the ABC. These buttons are for the user to guess from. To the right of the buttons, there will be a snowman. The snowman is there to gradually melt with the userâ€™s incorrect guesses. On the bottom of the screen, there will be a blank white box. This box is to display the lines for the mystery word. 
When the user presses start, the computer will select a mystery word. A select number of lines will appear on the bottom of the screen, representing the number of letters in the mystery word. The user will try to guess the mystery word by guessing its letters. The user will click on a letter to guess it. If the word contains the letter, it will turn green, and it will replace the line(s) representing it on the bottom of the screen. If the word does not contain the letter, it will turn red, and a part of the snowman will melt. There are 6 parts to the snowman which will disappear one at a time. The goal of the game is for the user to guess all the letters in the word, before the entire snowman melts.

*The full spec for the game is in the repo*
